# SmileSchool - Advanced HTML/CSS Project

## Welcome to SmileSchool!
This project is an exciting journey into the world of web development, following the "HTML, advanced concept" guidelines. Our mission? To create a stunning webpage for SmileSchool, a platform dedicated to teaching the art of smiling, using only HTML, CSS, and a dash of JavaScript. Get ready to dive into a design inspired by our Figma draft and learn from the pros!

## Project Overview
SmileSchool is all about spreading joy through smiles! This project focuses on building a responsive and visually appealing webpage, with a strong emphasis on CSS styling. The design is crafted to showcase tutorials, testimonials, and a call to action, all while adhering to W3C standards.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, youâ€™ll be able to explain to anyone (without Googling):
- What CSS is and how it transforms web pages.
- How to add styles to HTML elements like a pro.
- The power of classes and selectors in CSS.
- How to compute CSS Specificity Value for precise styling.
- The magic of Box properties in CSS layout.
- The behind-the-scenes process of how browsers load webpages.

## Requirements
- All files end with a new line for clean coding practices.
- A `README.md` file is mandatory at the project root (thatâ€™s this file!).
- No external libraries (no NodeJS, React, VueJS, or Bootstrapâ€”pure HTML/CSS/JS power only!).
- Code must be W3C compliant and validate with the W3C-Validator.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**: Grab the code from your GitHub repo.
2. **Explore the Files**: Check out `index.html` for the structure and `css_advanced.css` for styling (coming soon!).
3. **Open in Browser**: Launch `index.html` in your favorite web browser to see the magic unfold.
4. **Customize**: Feel free to tweak `index.html`â€”add logos or images from the `images` folder as needed.

## Design Inspiration
The stunning design is based on a Figma draft ("Headphone company" adapted for SmileSchool). Duplicate it to your Drafts on Figma to explore the full visionâ€”colors, layouts, and all!

## Next Steps
- Style `index.html` with `css_advanced.css` using the Figma design as your guide.
- Validate your code with the W3C-Validator to ensure perfection.
- Share your masterpiece with the world!
